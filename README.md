## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into Alzheimer's diagnosis trends by analyzing various factors such as gender, dietary habits, stress levels, sleep quality, and more. By visualizing patient data, the dashboard helps in identifying potential risk factors and patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Patients: 74.28K  
Patients Diagnosed with Alzheimer's:  30.71K (41.38% of total patients)  
Patients Without Alzheimer's:  43.57K (58.62% of total patients)  

## Data Visualization and Insights
Alzheimer’s Diagnosis by Country (Map View) 
   - A world map displaying Alzheimer's prevalence across different countries in South and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia .  

Diagnosed Cases by Gender (Cluster Column Chart) 
   - Females: 15.38K diagnosed  
   - Males:15.34K diagnosed  
   - Diagnosis rates appear nearly equal between genders.
     
Alzheimer's Cases by Genetic Factor (Cluster Column Chart) 
  - 8,923 diagnosed patients have Alzheimer's due to the genetic factor (APOE-ε4 allele).
  - 21,790 diagnosed patients do not have a genetic predisposition.
  - A significant number of Alzheimer's cases occur without a genetic link, indicating other contributing factors.
    
Alzheimer's Diagnosis by Hypertension (Stacked Column Chart)
  - 9,138 diagnosed patients have hypertension.
  - 21,575 diagnosed patients do not have hypertension.
  - Although hypertension is a risk factor, a majority of Alzheimer's cases occur in patients without hypertension, indicating multiple contributing factors.
 

Diagnosed cases by Family History (Cluster Column Chart) 
  - 19,140 diagnosed patients have no family history of Alzheimer's.
  - 11,573 diagnosed patients have a family history of Alzheimer's.
  - While genetics can be a risk factor, a larger portion of cases occur without a family history, suggesting other influences like lifestyle and environmental factors.
    
Diagnosis by Stress Levels (Stacked Column Chart)
   - High Stress: 10.29K diagnosed  
   - Medium Stress: 10.24K diagnosed  
   - Low Stress: 10.18K diagnosed  
   - Higher stress levels may have a marginal impact on Alzheimer's diagnosis.  

Diagnosis by Sleep Quality (Stacked Column Chart)
   - Good Sleep: 10.38K diagnosed  
   - Average Sleep: 10.22K diagnosed  
   - Poor Sleep: 10.12K diagnosed  
   - Poor sleep quality appears to slightly increase the risk.  

Diagnosis by Age Group (Stacked Bar Chart) 
-  50-54 years: 1.32K diagnosed  
-  55-59 years: 1.31K diagnosed  
-  60-64 years:  1.31K diagnosed  
-  65-69 years:  2.67K diagnosed  
-  70-74 years: 2.96K diagnosed  
-  75-79 years: 4.89K diagnosed  
-  80-84 years: 5.47K diagnosed  
-  85-89 years: 5.45K diagnosed  
-  90-94 years: 5.39K diagnosed  
Insight: The risk of Alzheimer's significantly increases with age.  

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer's, with cases rising as patients grow older. Gender differences in diagnosis are minimal, while genetic factor, stress levels, and sleep quality show only slight variations in their impact. Interestingly there is a potential correlation between hypertension and reduced Alzheimer's prevalence. These insights can help medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers develop better preventive strategies and early intervention programs.
