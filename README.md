## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into Alzheimer's diagnosis trends by analyzing various factors such as gender, dietary habits, stress levels, sleep quality, and more. By visualizing patient data, the dashboard helps in identifying potential risk factors and patterns associated with Alzheimer's disease.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Total Patients: 74.28K  
Patients Diagnosed with Alzheimer's:  30.71K (41.38% of total patients)  
Patients Without Alzheimer's:  43.57K (58.62% of total patients)  

## Data Visualization and Insights
Alzheimerâ€™s Diagnosis by Country (Map View) 
   - A world map displaying Alzheimer's prevalence across different countries.  

Diagnosis by Gender (Cluster Column Chart) 
   - Females: 15.38K diagnosed  
   - Males:15.34K diagnosed  
   - Diagnosis rates appear nearly equal between genders.  

Diagnosis by Dietary Habits (Funnel Chart) 
   - Healthy Diet: 24.69K diagnosed  
   - Average Diet: 24.92K diagnosed  
   - Unhealthy Diet: 24.68K diagnosed  
   - Minimal difference in Alzheimer's cases based on diet, though a slight increase with an average diet.  

Diagnosis by Hypertension (Pie Chart)  
   - The correlation between hypertension and Alzheimer's indicates a decrease in frequency among hypertensive patients.  

Urban vs. Rural Living (Funnel Chart) 
   - Rural Patients Diagnosed: 15.46K  
   - Urban Patients Diagnosed: 15.26K  
   - Slightly higher diagnosis rates in rural areas.  

Diagnosis by Stress Levels (Funnel Chart)
   - High Stress: 10.29K diagnosed  
   - Medium Stress: 10.24K diagnosed  
   - Low Stress: 10.18K diagnosed  
   - Higher stress levels may have a marginal impact on Alzheimer's diagnosis.  

Diagnosis by Sleep Quality (Funnel Chart)
   - Good Sleep: 10.38K diagnosed  
   - Average Sleep: 10.22K diagnosed  
   - Poor Sleep: 10.12K diagnosed  
   - Poor sleep quality appears to slightly increase the risk.  

Diagnosis by Age Group (Pie Chart) 
-  50-54 years: 1.32K diagnosed  
-  55-59 years: 1.31K diagnosed  
-  60-64 years:  1.31K diagnosed  
-  65-69 years:  2.67K diagnosed  
-  70-74 years: 2.96K diagnosed  
-  75-79 years: 4.89K diagnosed  
-  80-84 years: 5.47K diagnosed  
-  85-89 years: 5.45K diagnosed  
-  90-94 years: 5.39K diagnosed  
Insight: The risk of Alzheimer's significantly increases with age.  

## Conclusion
The analysis suggests that age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer's, with cases rising as patients grow older. Gender differences in diagnosis are minimal, while dietary habits, stress levels, and sleep quality show only slight variations in their impact. Interestingly, rural populations have slightly higher diagnosis rates, and there is a potential correlation between hypertension and reduced Alzheimer's prevalence. These insights can help medical professionals, researchers, and policymakers develop better preventive strategies and early intervention programs.
